    <title>Array in JS</title>

<body>
    <p>
    <h2> let's learn Array in JS</h2>
    <ul>Array is a collection of similar kind of item. </ul>
    <ul>It is used to store the miultiple values of the similar kind</ul>
    <ul>It is internally an JS object, there is no type like array but when you check the type of any array it will turn
        out to be an object</li><br>
        <ul><b>>Why we do not use object and array:</b> </ul>
        <ul>Object also also store the key value paid but you need to kcreate a key separately for each value which is
            not a good practice. Now if array is also a kind of object but it inlcudes a indices and value pair amd you
            do not need to give a name to each value.</ul>
        <ul>IN JS STRINGS are IMMUTABLE but ARRAYS are MUTABLE - this means we can change the individual value at
            particular position in an array without using any separate function</ul>
        </p>
