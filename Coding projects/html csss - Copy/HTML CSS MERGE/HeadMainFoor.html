                 <p>Currently, I am working at HABUILD. I have an experience of 1.5 years at Habuild. I began my career with the Wati communication team, where I developed strong communication skills that boosted my confidence. Due to my excellent performance, I was promoted to CRM. Later, I advanced to the role of CRM Backup, which enhanced my understanding of customer relationship management and allowed me to support the CRM team more effectively.
