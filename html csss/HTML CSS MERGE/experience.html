        <p style="font-size: large;">
            "Hey People...I am a passionate graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Application.
        Over the past 1.5 years, I've had the privilege of working at HaBUILD, where I've immersed myself in enriching experiences that have significantly enhanced my skills and unlocked my full potential.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: large;">
        I began my career with the Wati Communication Team, where I developed strong communication skills that boosted my confidence. Due to my excellent performance, I was promoted to CRM. Later, I advanced to the role of CRM Backup, which enhanced my understanding of Customer Relationship Management and allowed me to support the CRM team more effectively. Then I started working at Habuild as a Packet Lead handing the team of 5 members.
